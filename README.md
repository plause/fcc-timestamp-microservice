Timestamp Microservice
=====

__Objective:__ Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/
and deploy it to Heroku.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

__User Story:__ I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix
timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

__User Story:__ If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

__User Story:__ If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
